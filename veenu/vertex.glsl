VERTEX SHADER

Runs on each vertex of our 3D model.
It takes inputs like vertex position and normals and outputs a position in screen space, among other data.

uniform variables (preceded with "u"): global variables, same across all vertices

- uM: model matrix (object position, rotation, scale; transforms object space to world space)
- uN: normal matrix (object normals; transforms object's normal vectors correctly when object is transformed; used for lighting)
