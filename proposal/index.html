		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>

		<h4>The Problem + Where it is Challenging</h4>
		<p>In the context of animation, creating fluid motion often requires methods like relying on motion captured data or manually simulating 
			every frame, which can both often be extremely time consuming and computationally intensive, especially in real-time applications and 
			complex environments. Motion captured data is also limited to real life objects and thus often isn’t useful when building and animating 
			imaginary objects or characters. Currently, animation usually utilizes temporal keyframing, which captures movement through intermediate 
			poses at specific times and then interpolates between these poses. However, it can be difficult to produce smooth complex movements and makes 
			real-time responsiveness more challenging as well. 
		</p>

		<h4>Why it is Important</h4>
		<p>This issue is important because animation nowadays is becoming much more complex and interactive, and to keep up with this, we need to find 
			ways to more efficiently animate characters while also maintaining quality. Solving this problem would allow for much more creative freedom 
			in the context of animation and make it simpler, and thus more accessible, for users.</p>

		<h4>General Solution Idea</h4>
		<p>We plan to solve these issues by implementing spatial keyframing, where we can simply provide a couple important intermediate poses in 3D space 
			(instead of in time),  and we’re able to interpolate the rest of the frames based on the position of a control point in space and by blending 
			nearby intermediate poses. With this control point, it’s much easier to efficiently and smoothly animate characters or objects in real-time. 
			It also reduces the dependency on motion capture data, allowing for more flexibility and creative freedom in animating characters and objects.</p>

		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
		
		Our goal is to create an interactive UI that allows the user to do spatial keyframing themselves.
		<h3>What we plan to deliver</h3>
		<p>
			paragraph should address 
			<br>
			"what you are trying to accomplish": 
				at a high level: spatial keyframing capabilities with a single character in a fixed position in 3D space.
				at a lower level: what the UI will look like (button options, background, basic textiled ground, what character is in the middle, it's a 3D charactrer with shadows, etc).
			<br>
			"what results you are going for": describe what the user can do in this UI i.e. set keyframes by going into this mode, selecting certain body parts, moving them, etc. move between modes. etc. and the graphical results of it: smooth and reasonable interpolation, no hallucinations / wacky results, results look like what the user intended
			<br>
			"why you think you can accomplish those goals":
		</p>
		
		<h4>Interactive UI Core Features</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Set key frames: User can set dots and poses in 3D space</li>
			<li>Character rotation: User can rotate the character</li>
			<li>Lighting: Proper shadowing and lighting of character with a fixed light source</li>
			<li>Animate: Once the user has set key frames, they can drag their cursor around to animate the character</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What we hope to deliver</h3>
		<p>paragraph first, then list the features at the end</p>
