		<h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            So far, we have learned how to use Blender to create our character with keyframes,
            and render the character with these keyframes in a GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, we learned how to use Blender following
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y">this intro to Blender tutorial</a>
            to create a donut. Then, we built our own bear character, and learned rigging from
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIwrswJEFBQ">this rigging tutorial</a>
            to put the bear in different poses at different timestamps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, we set up our repository. We had initially looked at
            <a href="https://veeenu.github.io/blog/implementing-keyframe-animation/">
                this KeyFrame Animation resource
            </a>
            provided in our proposal feedback as a starting point, which used WebGL and Javascript to render in a browser.
            However, since we were used to working with OpenGL and C++ to render in a local window, we decided to use the Homework 4 repository as our starting point instead,
            still using the provided resource to learn about the interpolation algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Setting up and successfully building a repository was surprisingly a lot more difficult than we anticipated, since we had to integrate external libraries.
            We spent a whole day successfully creating, compiling and building our ext/, shaders/, and src/ directories, synonymous to the ones in Homework 4.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>In ext/, we have the nanogui, assimp, and CGL libraries.</li>
                <li>In src/, we have a main.cpp and a few other files to help load the FBX model and shader programs.</li>
                <li>In shaders/, we have a simple default vertex and fragment shader.</li>
                <li>We also have an additional models/ directory, where we have placed our FBX files.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, we tried to use FetchContent to download Assimp “on the fly”, but we ran into lots of problems using this approach.
            Since we saw that Homework 4 had submoduled the nanogui repo in ext/, we decided it was probably ok to do so with Assimp as well.
            After that, it was a matter of debugging issues with <code>cmake ..</code> and <code>make</code>, and rewriting <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            While setting up the repo, we also spent time building out our foundational understanding of tools that will be used in this project
            For example, learning about FBX files, referencing OpenGL/WebGL and using HW 4 part 5 as a guiding resource,
            figuring out CMake, using libraries like Assimp, Nanogui...
            Though we spent much of our time (more time than expected) understanding these basic concepts and tools,
            we believe that this is key to iterating quickly in the future, and now we are confident that we’ll be able to hit the ground running.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we were successful with compiling and building the repo with a simple NanoGUI window, we moved onto visualizing a simple model from an FBX file.
            We learned how to use Assimp to load in our FBX file and retrieve the data we needed for the bear.
            For the shader program, we used the default vertex shader from Homework 4, and Bling Phong without specular light for the fragment shader.
            The main issue here was that our camera was positioned in the wrong place, so we needed to set its position correctly so that we could see our model.
            Eventually, we got to the point where we could render our bear model and switch between different keyframed poses.</p>

        <p>
            Our current track and progress diverge from our initial schedule, largely because we decided to switch from spatial keyframing to temporal keyframing for the sake of simplicity.
            However, we are generally on track with the temporal equivalent of our spatial keyframing goals in the original schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our original proposal, we outlined that we’d spend Week 1 creating the 3D character in Blender
            and creating some sort of UI interface so that the user could manually select and set certain keyframe poses that we’d interpolate.
            However, this was a hefty goal, so for the sake of time, we decided to pivot and set all keyframes in Blender,
            saved to FBX files, instead of setting keyframes in the GUI.
            We will continue to touch it up, but we are satisfied with our progress in designing a model thus far.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 2 in the original proposal was learning and implementing hierarchial transform and a view scrolling algorithm.
            However, now that we are no longer doing spatial keyframing, we no longer needed to do that.
            As such, we took the time in Week 2 to do the creating the UI part from Week 1: setting up the repository and rendering FBX files in the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            From hereonout, our plan is pretty similar to the original. In week 3, we create the interpolation algorithm.
            On top of this now, we will fix any camera issues that occur, and design a program (classes, objects, etc)
            inspired by Homework 4's that will actually set us up to do this interpolation.
            Then Week 4 will be the same as the original: finish up anything from Week 3, and create the material for our Final Deliverable / Presentation.
